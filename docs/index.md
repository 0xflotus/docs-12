# Introduction

[Snaplet](https://snaplet.dev) copies a production database, transforming personal information so that developers can safely code against actual data. Coding against unrelastic data could lead to false assumptions that result in bugs and inaccurate features.

Your dev-env matches production. Why not do the same with the data? 

That's where Snaplet comes in!

Snaplet takes care of the entire snapshot workflow and gives you tools for copying, transforming, uploading and restoring your data.

It detects personally identifiable information and suggests realistic replacements.
